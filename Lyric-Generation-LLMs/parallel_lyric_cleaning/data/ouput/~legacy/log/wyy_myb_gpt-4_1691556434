[00:00.000] 作曲 : Sufjan Stevens
[00:45.323] Oh, to see without my eyes
[00:50.448] The first time that you kissed me
[00:55.735] Boundless by the time I cried
[01:01.007] I built your walls around me
[01:06.395] White noise, what an awful sound
[01:11.745] Fumbling by Rogue River
[01:17.121] Feel my feet above the ground
[01:22.623] Hand of God, deliver me
[01:27.131]
[01:27.947] Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
[01:32.933] The first time that you touched me
[01:38.549] Oh, will wonders ever cease?
[01:43.567] Blessed be the mystery of love
[01:50.072]
[02:10.613] Lord, I no longer believe
[02:15.699] Drowned in living waters
[02:21.069] Cursed by the love that I received
[02:26.331] From my brother's daughter
[02:31.641] Like Hephaestion, who died
[02:37.086] Alexander's lover
[02:42.433] Now my riverbed has dried
[02:47.749] Shall I find no other?
[02:52.816]
[02:53.126] Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
[02:58.406] I'm running like a plover
[03:03.713] Now I'm prone to misery
[03:08.987] The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
[03:16.116]
[03:36.063] How much sorrow can I take?
[03:41.232] Blackbird on my shoulder
[03:46.300] And what difference does it make
[03:51.729] When this love is over?
[03:56.950] Shall I sleep within your bed?
[04:02.318] River of unhappiness
[04:07.787] Hold your hands upon my head
[04:12.970] Till I breathe my last breath
